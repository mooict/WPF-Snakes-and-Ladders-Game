# WPF C# Tutorial â€“ Create a Snakes and Ladders Game in Visual Studio
Hello and welcome to this tutorial. This this tutorial we will make a snakes and ladders game in visual studio using WPF and C#. In this game you will click on the board to move the player and after the player makes a move the CPU will make its move too. You will move between 1 and 6 steps. The player and CPU will move to the numbered location on the board and If you land on bottom of the ladder you move up to where the ladder ends and if you land on the mouth of the snake then you will go down to where the tail ends.

You will win by making it to the top of the board before the CPU. One important rule of the game is that if you are on the top you will need the exact number of steps before you can make it to the end. Lets say you are on 97 in that case you will need to roll a 3 or below to move forward, if you roll anything bigger than that you will pass your round to the CPU and the same rules apply to the CPU.
